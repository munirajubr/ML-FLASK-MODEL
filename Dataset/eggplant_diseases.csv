VerticilliumWilt,Fungal Disease (Soil-borne),"Roots, stems, vascular system, leaves (indirect wilt symptoms)","Verticillium Wilt causes a gradual wilting of lower leaves, followed by yellowing and browning. Leaves may curl upward before drying and falling. The disease progresses upward, causing partial plant wilt. Cutting the stem reveals light brown to dark streaks in the vascular tissue. Plants become stunted, weak, and produce fewer flowers and fruits. Unlike bacterial wilt, wilting is slow and progressive, often occurring on one side of the plant.",Moderate,"* Cool to warm soil temperatures (20–28°C)
* Dry weather followed by irrigation
* Soil with long-term Verticillium contamination
* Poor crop rotation practices
* Low soil fertility

1. Remove wilted leaves to reduce plant stress.
2. Improve irrigation consistency to avoid drought stress.
3. Add compost or organic matter to improve soil health.
4. Mulch to stabilize soil moisture.
5. Prune affected branches to improve airflow and sunlight.
6. Remove nearby weeds and alternate hosts.
7. Avoid working around plants when soil is wet (reduces spread).

⚠️ Severe infections do not recover, and soil remains infected for years.","⚠️ No chemical completely cures Verticillium Wilt, but soil and root-zone fungicides provide partial suppression.

Possible management options include:

* Carbendazim drenching – partial suppression
* Trichoderma viride / harzianum – biological control

Yellow Disease,"Physiological / Viral / Nutritional Disorder
(Depending on the cause: nutrient deficiency, virus, phytoplasma, or stress)","Leaves (primary), shoots, stems (indirect), whole plant vigor","Yellow Disease is characterized by uniform or patchy yellowing of leaves, beginning from the older leaves in nutrient deficiency cases, or from upper leaves in viral infections. Leaves become pale, thin, and chlorotic, while veins may remain green (interveinal chlorosis). Plants show reduced growth, weak stems, poor flowering, and delayed fruit development. In severe cases, leaves may dry prematurely. Causes include nitrogen or iron deficiency, virus infection, water stress, or root damage.",Moderate,"* Poor soil fertility
* High rainfall leading to nutrient leaching
